    <h2>A Case Study In the Jorhat distict of Assam,India</h2>
    <p> 
          Introduction: At present, about 217 million children, all over the world work as labourer. The presence of such a large number of child labourers is regarded as a serious issue in terms of economic welfare. Children who work fail to get necessary education. They do not get the opportunity to develop physically, intellectually, emotionally and psychologically. 
          Hence it is an urgent need of the hour to analyse the matter, thoroughly, so that effective attempts could  be made for eradication of the problem. Thorough analysis requires micro level study since the scenario of child labour may vary place to place, time to time, state to state and country to country so also their addressing policy. The present work is an attempt in this regard considering Jorhat district of Assam, India, as locale of the study.
